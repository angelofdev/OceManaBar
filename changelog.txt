0.4
- added gradient mana bar
- changed configuration's folder name to plugin's name
- bugfixes and safety checks

0.3
- added configuration to character segment, waiting to create a color-filled bar
- added permission to show/hide mana bar

0.2 -> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/25308568/OceManaBar_0.2.jar
- added configuration nodes to height, width, number of segments, position X and Y
- added configurable "maxmana" value, set it equal to "maxmana" of magicspells, is a workaround for now because i can't access that value from the extern
- added configuration "shownumeric" to show/hide numeric values near the mana bar [mana/maxmana]

0.1 -> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/25308568/OceManaBar_0.1.jar
- First release, many things to do!

Planned:
DONE: configurable X and Y from the screen.
DONE: configurable height - width
DONE: configurable size
DONE: implement permissions
- use values from magicspell config
- configurable colors for full/empty bar and delimiters
DONE change the bar type to color-filled instead of text (it's a bit advanced I think, but I'll try)
DONE: - optional [current value / total value] near mana bar (now is always displayed)
- use magicspell events to update mana value instead of player move (if you stand still, mana doesn't update). this will use A LOT of less CPU.
